    - Changed how indexing happens when uploading. Found that OrePAN2 when recreating the index can take a lot of time when you have many packages in your repo. Complete reindexing will use a subprocess
    - Added /reindex to manually kick off index creation
    - Fixed issues in /list process where provides names were being added incorrectly to other packages in JSON response
    - Added convenience routines to Mojo::Darkpan::Config
    - Added routines to Mojo::Darkpan::Util for indexing
